Here is what gistfinder does

# Configuration
Gistfinder will need permission from Github to access your gists.
The best way to set this up is to create a personal access token that
gistfinder can use to download your gists to your computer.


Here are the steps:

1. Choose "Settings" from your profile at the upper right corner of you Github home page.
1. Go to "Developer Settings"
1. Choose "Personal access tokens"
1. Generate a new token
1. Name the token something descriptive. Perhaps "gistfinder"
1. Limit the permissions to only have access to gist
1. Copy the created token to use for configuing gistfinder
